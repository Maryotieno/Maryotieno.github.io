# WEEK 2 LAB CHALLENGE
**Problem Statement:** BUILD A SWITCH AND A ROUTER, INTRODUCTION TO NETWORK TRAFFIC ANALYSIS

**Approach:** To approach this challenge, I first used Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate a basic network setup. I configured a switch and a router, and connected multiple end devices to create a small LAN. I assigned IP addresses, set up routing protocols, and verified connectivity using ICMP (ping).

Once the topology was operational, I initiated traffic between devices and began analyzing it using HTB Academy's traffic capture tools. I inspected packet flows, ARP requests, and ICMP echo replies to understand how devices communicated across the network.

I focused on:

Identifying common protocols (e.g., ICMP, ARP)

Understanding MAC and IP address resolution

Observing how routers forward packets between networks

Capturing and interpreting packet details using simulated packet capture tools

This hands-on setup helped reinforce foundational networking concepts and gave practical exposure to analyzing traffic at different OSI layers.
